Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Africa's Talking account (sign up for free)
NVIDIA GPU recommended (but not required)
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forex-monitoring-agent.git
cd forex-monitoring-agent
Create and activate virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:
bash
cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file with your credentials:

env
# Forex Alert Agent Configuration
AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=your_africastalking_username
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=your_africastalking_api_key
YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER=+2547XXXXXXXX  # Format: +2547XXXXXXXX
Running the Agent

bash
python forex_agent.py
Configuration

Customize the agent behavior by modifying these parameters in the code:

python
# Core configuration parameters
monitored_pairs = ["EUR/USD", "USD/JPY", "GBP/USD", "AUD/USD"]
alert_thresholds = {
    "emergency_price": 1.5,  # Percentage change
    "price_spike": 0.8       # Percentage change
}
news_keywords = ["interest rate", "inflation", "policy", "crisis", "war"]
african_currencies = ["USD/KES", "USD/ZAR", "USD/NGN"]  # Add African currency pairs
Event Priorities

Event Type	Priority	Description
emergency_price	1	Extreme price movements (>1.5%)
breaking_news	1	Critical news events
price_spike	2	Significant price movements (>0.8%)
news	3	Important but not critical news
status_update	4	System health checks
Africa's Talking Integration

Voice Call Configuration

The agent uses Africa's Talking Voice API to make calls. Key implementation details:

python
import africastalking

# Initialize SDK
africastalking.initialize(
    username=os.getenv('AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME'),
    api_key=os.getenv('AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY')
)

# Create voice service instance
voice = africastalking.Voice

# Make call
call = voice.call(
    callFrom='+254711XXXYYY',  # Your Africa's Talking virtual number
    callTo=[os.getenv('YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER')]
)
Benefits for African Users

Local Phone Number Support: Works seamlessly with local phone numbers
Cost-Effective: Lower call rates for African networks
Network Optimization: Better connectivity with local carriers
SMS Fallback: Option to add SMS notifications for failed calls
Customization

Integrating Real Data Sources

Replace the simulated data streams with real APIs:

Market Data (Uncomment and implement in market_data_stream()):
python
# Real implementation example
async def real_market_data_stream():
    async with connect("wss://api.forexpros.com/ws") as ws:
        await ws.send(json.dumps({"action": "subscribe", "symbols": ["EUR/USD"]}))
        while True:
            data = await ws.recv()
            # Process real market data
News Feed (Uncomment and implement in news_monitor()):
python
# Real news API implementation
async def real_news_monitor():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=forex") as response:
            data = await response.json()
            # Process real news data
Modifying AI Behavior

Adjust the prompt engineering for African market focus:

python
# Custom analysis prompt with African context
custom_prompt = (
    f"Act as a forex analyst specializing in African markets. For {pair} movement of {change}%, "
    "consider impact on African currencies and economies. "
    "Provide trading recommendations relevant to African traders:"
)
Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Africa's Talking connection errors:
Verify username and API key
Ensure phone number is in E.164 format (+2547XXXXXXXX)
Check account balance in Africa's Talking dashboard
Slow AI responses:
Enable GPU acceleration
Reduce max_new_tokens parameter
Use model quantization
Missed events:
Decrease sleep intervals in monitors
Increase queue capacity
Adjust alert thresholds
Africa's Talking Specific Tips

Issue	Solution
Call not connecting	Verify number format (+2547XXXXXXXX)
Call drops quickly	Increase message length to >5 seconds
No voice heard	Check text-to-speech formatting
Authorization errors	Verify username/api key combination
